# Who am I?

My name is **Javier Solís García**, and I am an AI/ML engineer with experience in both research and practical applications of artificial intelligence. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Avature, where I apply and adapt language and consistency models to tackle new challenges in NLP.

My journey began while studying **Software Engineering at the University of Seville (2017–2021)**, where I first developed a strong interest in AI. During my undergraduate years, I was already collaborating on research projects, and since then I have continued to deepen my expertise in the field. I went on to pursue a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (2021–2022)**, where my thesis focused on hierarchical reinforcement learning. I am now completing my **PhD in AI at the University of Seville (2022–2025)**, with a dissertation on time series imputation using generative models.

I’ve had the opportunity to work in diverse environments:

- At **AtenIA Labs** (a spin-off of the University of Seville), where I developed computer vision models for drones, fault diagnosis in wind turbines, and anomaly detection in solar panels.
- As a **specialist in Big Data and Deep Learning**, contributing to research on disease prediction in ICUs and forecasting in electricity markets.
- Currently at **Avature**, focusing on generative models, NLP, and advanced deep learning applications.

Over the years, I have worked across a wide range of AI fields, including:

- Generative models (diffusion, GANs, consistency).
- Time series and spatiotemporal systems.
- NLP and LLMs.
- Computer vision.
- Reinforcement learning.
- Graph-based models and metaheuristics.

# My motivation

I have always benefited from open access to papers, repositories, and community-shared resources. That is one of the reasons I decided to create this website and personal blog: to give back some of that knowledge.

Here you’ll find notes, summaries, and reflections drawn from my research, personal projects, and industry experience. I aim to keep them clear, with references whenever possible, and always with the goal of contributing to the community that has supported me from the very beginning.

Please feel free to connect with me through the links I provide if you would like to get in touch!
